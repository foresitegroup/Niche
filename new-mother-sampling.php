<h1>New Mother in Hospital Co-op Sampling</h2>

<strong>Program Description</strong><br>

<img src="images/new-mother1.jpg" alt="" class="right">

Working with both of the leading brands of baby formula, new mothers can be reached with both product samples and/or promotional offers/coupons.  Up to 250,000 per month new moms can be reached in a controlled environment with minimal waste year-round.<br>
<br>

As new mothers are discharged from hospitals across the U.S., gifts (e.g. sling bags, diaper bags) are hand-distributed by hospital staff. Each includes product samples, information; and offers specifically for women as they take their newborns home.<br>
<br>

Participating brands receive the implied endorsement as this audience enters a new life stage.<br>
<br>

<strong>Key Elements</strong><br>
<ul>
  <li>Quantity: Up to 3,000,000 annually</li>
  <li>Timing: Year-round as desired</li>
</ul>
